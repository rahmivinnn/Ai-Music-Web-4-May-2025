const lyrics = `
Verse 1:
I see you walking by
You never notice me
I practice what to say
But words don't come so easily
My heart beats faster when you're near
But you don't seem to feel the same

Chorus:
I'm waiting for your love
Like rain in a drought
Hoping for a sign
That you'll turn around
My heart keeps on beating
For someone who doesn't know
I'm waiting for your love
But should I let you go?

Verse 2:
I drop hints all the time
You miss them every day
My friends all tell me that
I should just walk away
But something keeps me here
Hoping that someday you'll see

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
Maybe I'm a fool
For holding on this long
Maybe it's time to face the truth
That we don't belong
But my heart won't listen
To what my mind knows is true

(Repeat Chorus)

Outro:
I'm waiting for your love
But maybe it's time to let you go
